# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing bank loan performance, risk assessment, and lending portfolio optimization. This interactive dashboard provides deep insights into loan approval patterns, default risks, and customer segmentation.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Financial institutions and peer-to-peer lending platforms face critical challenges in:
- **Default Risk Prediction**: Understanding which loans are likely to default and identifying early warning signs
- **Portfolio Performance Analysis**: Evaluating the success rate of different loan categories and customer segments
- **Geographic Risk Assessment**: Identifying high-risk and low-risk regions for lending activities
- **Customer Profiling**: Understanding how borrower characteristics (employment, credit grade, home ownership) impact loan outcomes
- **Risk-Based Pricing**: Developing strategies for interest rate setting based on risk assessment

The challenge was to analyze a large dataset of 38,577 loans to identify patterns, validate risk models, and provide actionable insights for improving lending decisions and portfolio management.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Did

We developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that consolidates loan data into a single, interactive analytical platform. Our work involved:

### Data Preparation & Integration
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed 38,577 loan records, standardized loan status categories, and handled missing values
- **Data Transformation**: Created calculated fields for default rates, success rates, and risk metrics by different segments
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between loan characteristics, borrower demographics, and loan outcomes

### Dashboard Development
- **KPI Design**: Built comprehensive metrics for loan success rates (83.33% fully paid), default rates (13.82% charged off), and portfolio performance
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created dynamic charts for loan status distribution, geographic performance, and risk analysis by credit grade
- **Geographic Mapping**: Implemented location-based analysis showing loan performance variations across different states
- **Customer Segmentation**: Developed borrower profiling based on employment length, credit grade, and home ownership

### Key Features Implemented
- **Loan Status Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of fully paid, charged off, and current loans
- **Risk Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of default rates by credit grade, employment length, and loan purpose
- **Geographic Insights**: State-wise analysis of loan performance and risk patterns
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: Detailed analysis from portfolio level to individual loan characteristics

## ðŸ“ˆ What We Understood & Insights

### Loan Performance Analysis
- **Loan Status Distribution**: Analyzed 38,577 loans with 83.33% fully paid, 13.82% charged off, and 2.85% currently active
- **Default Risk Assessment**: Identified key factors contributing to loan defaults including employment length, credit grade, and loan purpose
- **Geographic Risk Patterns**: Discovered variations in loan performance across different states and regions

### Customer Segmentation Insights
- **Employment Impact**: Found correlation between employment length and loan success rates
- **Credit Grade Analysis**: Analyzed how loan grades (A-G) and sub-grades impact default probabilities
- **Home Ownership Patterns**: Studied the relationship between home ownership status and loan performance

### Portfolio Risk Management
- **Loan Purpose Analysis**: Evaluated which loan purposes (car, home improvement, debt consolidation, etc.) have higher success rates
- **Interest Rate Correlation**: Studied the relationship between interest rates and default rates across different risk categories
- **Term Length Impact**: Analyzed how loan terms (36 vs 60 months) affect repayment success

### Key Learnings & Business Impact
- **Risk Scoring Validation**: Validated the effectiveness of credit grading systems in predicting loan outcomes
- **Geographic Risk Mapping**: Identified high-risk and low-risk geographic areas for targeted lending strategies
- **Customer Profiling**: Developed insights for better customer targeting and risk assessment
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Learned strategies for balancing loan approval rates with risk management
